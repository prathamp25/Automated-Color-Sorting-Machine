# Automated-Color-Sorting-Machine

In this project we will develop an Arduino-based color sorting machine. This project will help us gain valuable skills in Arduino coding and embedded systems. The color sorting machine is designed to identify and sort objects based on their color using a combination of sensors and actuators.

The machine utilizes a color sensor to detect the color of the objects passing through it. The Arduino microcontroller processes the color data and triggers the appropriate actuator to sort the objects into different compartments or bins based on their colors. This sorting process is automated and efficient, reducing the need for manual sorting.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of semiconductor physics principles and their practical applications in real-world projects. I learned how to program Arduino boards, interface sensors and actuators, and troubleshoot issues related to embedded systems.
